This is still in its early stages, and if you are in the ring that it's available in, remember to submit feedback and issues you spot directly through the console via **Report a problem**.

You may even see me more around r/xboxinsiders. :D (And to head this off, yes, we are still working on mobile app updates to bring parity there. We also still want to know about touch improvements you think we should make. We're listening, however we do not have updates to share about those items at this time.)\n\nOne major announcement today, and this is something y'all have been expecting, [(10) Microsoft Edge Legacy desktop application support ends today : MicrosoftEdge (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/m1bxn7/microsoft_edge_legacy_desktop_application_support/). [onmst.com](https://onmst.com) has already spotted this feature update, and this won't be in Dev until next week (we expect), but we're bringing [Immersive Reader support to Wikipedia pages](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/make-reading-wikipedia-content-easier-and-more-accessible-with/m-p/2195539) (something **this community** specifically requested).

Shahina and team are really excited to hear what you think about these two, so install Canary via the download link below to test these out today! The team also posted a blog about performance in Edge 89, which is currently in our Stable channel. [(10) Microsoft Edge 89: Delivering improved browser performance to get the job done : MicrosoftEdge (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/m1c1sv/microsoft_edge_89_delivering_improved_browser/)  (Again, enjoy my notifications number in the URL for these posts.)\n\nThis week's update is slightly smaller, normally we have a lot of things put into our last release before a major update. You can now sort Collections (both the collections themselves AND the items inside of them), the Downloads flyout now supports drag and drop, we added an option to disable the developer mode extensions popup (*this popup only appears in Beta and Stable channels right now*), and finished rolling out startup boost to those in our Dev channel. We also fixed a couple issues around video showing a black screen but audio playing just fine and where images weren't displaying properly. To read about these improvements, changes, fixes, and more, click the **Change Summary** link below.\n\nTop Feedback update this week is super light after a pretty hefty week last week. Y'all should expect to see font rendering improvements in Canary this month! This is feedback we've seen since we moved over to chromium, and I'll provide updates as I get them.

Josh details all of these and more in his post, so click the &lt;strong&gt;Change Summary&lt;/strong&gt; button below to read about these.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your top feedback updates include addressing one item related to losing passwords and a Windows update, as well as a few items getting months you can expect them to be available in our Canary channel. We talk about when you can get back to where you left off in PDFs and tab groups in today&amp;#39;s update, so be sure to click the link for the &lt;strong&gt;Top Feedback Summary&lt;/strong&gt; to read more!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all for this week, everyone. &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/MSEdgeDev/status/1371503067095519233""&gt;Thursday at 10am Pacific Time&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;re going to be hosting another &lt;a href=""https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Ask-the-Expert/Ask-the-Expert-Top-Reasons-to-Love-Microsoft-Edge""&gt;Ask The Expert session about the Top Reasons to Love Microsoft Edge&lt;/a&gt;.

I'm the owner of a Surface Pro X and have come to conclusion that Edge is the killer app for the Windows ARM platform. As many of you'd know there are significant gaps in that platform.

Edge also allows Surface owners to take advantage their pen now inking has been introduced. Collections are awesome. Plus, you have a full desktop grade browser with extensions, which is not something you get on other tablets.

,edge,"Hi,

I'm getting the above message and a couple of extensions disabled and removed on multiple machines. What would be causing this. Is it something on Microsoft's end or something else. Both extensions have been working for a few months. The Extensions will be disabled and removed from the registry  *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Edge\\ExtensionInstallForcelist*

Are there logs for extensions that I can analyse?

Other possible ideas for causes are:

* Windows Defender version changes
* AV
* SmartScreen
* Symantec DLP
* Group Policy Settings

,edge,"Hello,

This is not a bug or an issue per se, but it's just a general question. 

Now that VP9 hardware decoding is supported on macOS since Chromium 90, I can now play 4k video on YouTube more effectively and efficiently (CPU-wise).

However, I have noticed that 4K YouTube video playback leads to increased disk-writes through the Utility-Network Service as observed in Terminal. After watching maybe a 15 minute 4k video, Utility Network Service has written 1.5 GB to the SSD. 

When I view 4k Video using Edge Dev on my Intel Mac with the same video, this is not the case. It writes far lower (&lt;300 MB) with the same video.

I'm **not** overly concerned about this, but I am curious as to why it is happening.

,edge,"Hi! 

I am sharing this observation hoping you will respond and share your opinion on that.

I have just finished installing macOS Catalina on my Hackintosh and am in the midst of getting all that software installed and running again that I need mainly as a web developer. I already installed Chrome and am even logged in, so all the sync'ed settings like bookmarks show up.

Now, after having installed Microsoft Edge and starting it \_for the very first time\_, it asks me, whether I want to import bookmarks from other browsers. What I can see behind this modal is that \*\*all the Chrome bookmarks are already showing up\*\* in Edge's bookmark bar!!! I haven't even selected \_yes\_ nor \_no\_, nevertheless Edge \*\*already imported\*\* them!

Then, after choosing \_No\_ those bookmarks disappear again.

I think it is only fair to assume that the initial unasked import of all available data does not stop at bookmarks. What about stored address data, passwords, search history, bank account details and whatever else you can sync with Chrome?

In my opinion this is a serious privacy infringement.

It's great to be able to install websites as if they are fake local apps.  
I use Edge mainly for this reason. I have many websites pinned to my task-bar as individual icons and some of the time this works great.  

However; does anyone else have the persistent issue that Edge 'forgets' that these stand alone apps are not regular browser windows; and starts to group them with browser windows on the taskbar?  

That is, the pinned icons begin to behave just like a regular shortcut; they never become 'active' because the taskbar thinks another Edge window has just been launched.  

This seems to get muddled up often, especially between updates.  

I understand that the dev version is likely to have issues as things are worked on; but does anyone else have this issue - and have you found a way to fix it?  

I tried switching my apps over to stable - but the same issue occurs.  

It's as if the browser is forgetting to give 'Web Apps' their own unique window ID to the Windows API, and is instead mislabeling them as 'MSEdge'.

,edge,"Hi.

The function to import passwords from a .csv file has finally arrived to Edge in its Dev version, in the stable channel it has not arrived yet but while it arrives you can try it in Edge Dev. To be able to import our passwords, all we have to do is to activate the following flag:

https://preview.redd.it/i9cc6qredom61.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=846630e5d19c6f9dd1b606db249675ccb6e5f8c8

And here is how you can see the change before and after activating the flag.

# BEFORE

[Export passwords only. How the hell did the Edge people forget to add an import function?](https://i.redd.it/srex1lspbom61.gif)

# AFTER

[We already have here the function Import passwords, very useful and necessary.](https://i.redd.it/rfoufn2xbom61.gif)

That feature came with the latest version of Edge Dev, and you can only import passwords from a .csv file since the export passwords feature saves them in that format.

If you have your passwords in an HTML file you will have to convert it to a csv file so that Edge can do the import without any problem.

,edge,"Edge Dev 90.0.796.0

I primarily use Edge for it's feature of installing websites as 'An App'.  
Most of my apps are 'Installed' in the dev version.  
The reason for this is that the dev version was available before the official one - so when the official one finally came out; I had already amassed a decent list of installed 'Apps', and there is no method to back-up/restore or otherwise transfer installed 'Apps' from one Edge profile to another.  

But I digress; lately, I wake up in the morning and all the instances of web 'Apps' that I had open are gone.  
Edge has killed them all.  

I can only imagine this is some kind of background update activity going on with Edge Dev.  

This didn't used to be so bad; because I have extensions like Session Buddy installed - which capture all my open windows and allow me to quickly restore them.  

This extension used to list open web 'Apps' as a regular browser window - however when you restored them, they would correctly restore as an 'App' with their own icon / separate taskbar entry not grouped with the browser ones.  
This stopped working recently with an Edge Dev update.  

Since then, further updates have made it so that now the web 'Apps' that are open aren't even captured in session buddy any more - so I have no way to restore them after they are killed by Edge in the night.

I have been using Edge for a few months now.

However with New Edge, features have been stripped. Some noticeable some not. I thought compatibility with chrome extensions was neat, but that was just a way to try to patch together this new edge experience.

,edge,"Usually, I open multiple tabs in quick succession by middle-clicking the bookmarks I wish to open. A week ago, this stopped working.

Now when trying to open a bookmark within a folder in a new tab, the first bookmark I middle-click opens successfully, but then no other bookmarks within that folder can be opened in a new tab (either by middle-click or by right-click -&gt; ""Open in new tab"") until I close the folder to remove focus from it, and then open it again. (And again, it only works for the first bookmark clicked to open in a new tab).

The bug is only reproducible when you attempt to open that first bookmark-within-a-folder with a middle-click, as if you instead right-click -&gt; ""Open in new tab"", the folder is immediately closed, and so focus has already been removed. The folder only stays open to allow you to open consecutive bookmarks with middle-clicking.

,edge,"PDF reader improvements added today:

&gt;**Page scrolling on PDF documents.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Starting with Microsoft Edge version 92, you will be able to scroll through each page or two pages in case of two page layout when reading PDF documents.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Navigate PDF documents using page thumbnails.**  
&gt;  
&gt;You will now be able to navigate through your PDF document using thumbnails representing the pages. These thumbnails will appear in the pane on the left side of the PDF reader (v.92).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Scrolling improvements for PDF documents.**  
&gt;  
&gt;We are improving scrolling performance for a smoother scroll experience in PDF documents. ***You should not longer see white bars appearing during scrolling*** (v.91).

&amp;#x200B;

Passwords:

&gt;[**Bulk-delete passwords.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/lr3224/in_edge_canary_you_can_now_delete_multiple_or_all/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  
&gt;  
&gt;Starting with Microsoft Edge version 90, you will be able to delete multiple saved passwords in a single action.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Warning on passwords strength &amp; reuse.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Beginning in Microsoft Edge v.91, we will give feedback to you on which of your passwords are weak and/or reused across accounts. This will allow you to stay informed about your security on the web.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Require autenticación before filling passwords.**  
&gt;  
&gt;With this capability, passwords saved to the browser will no longer be autofilled. They will need a successful user authentication prior to filling. This will add another layer of privacy and help prevent non-authorized users from using saved passwords to log into websites.

&amp;#x200B;

Collections:

&gt;**Ability to add web capture to Collections.**  
&gt;  
&gt;You can take screenshots of webpages and annotate using Web Capture feature. You will also be able to add these captures to your collections and they will synch across all your devices (v.91).

&amp;#x200B;

History:

&gt;**Synced browser history support for history search.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Searching your history is currently limited to your local data. This feature enables you to search your local and synced browser history (v.90).

&amp;#x200B;

There are other features added today but I did not include them because they were already known (like the new Collections and Downloads flyouts menus) or because they already appear in the ""[Top feedback summary](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/top-feedback-summary-for-march-3/m-p/2182562)"".

&lt;p&gt;Starting with Microsoft Edge version 90, you will be able to delete multiple saved passwords in a single action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning on passwords strength &amp;amp; reuse.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning in Microsoft Edge v.91, we will give feedback to you on which of your passwords are weak and/or reused across accounts. This will allow you to stay informed about your security on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Require autenticación before filling passwords.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this capability, passwords saved to the browser will no longer be autofilled. They will need a successful user authentication prior to filling. This will add another layer of privacy and help prevent non-authorized users from using saved passwords to log into websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ability to add web capture to Collections.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can take screenshots of webpages and annotate using Web Capture feature. You will also be able to add these captures to your collections and they will synch across all your devices (v.91).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synced browser history support for history search.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching your history is currently limited to your local data. This feature enables you to search your local and synced browser history (v.90).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other features added today but I did not include them because they were already known (like the new Collections and Downloads flyouts menus) or because they already appear in the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/top-feedback-summary-for-march-3/m-p/2182562""&gt;Top feedback summary&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had to end the task, and i&amp;#39;m trying to restart and update to resolve the issue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any reason why this happened?&lt;/p&gt;

,edge,"I've been wanting to use Edge v90 on Edge Dev because of the VP9 hardware decoding support on macOS.

However, there seems to be memory leakage when using Edge when viewing 4K video. I've reported it to Microsoft, but I was wondering if anyone else is seeing it. **VTDecoderXPCService** has used more than 7 GB of RAM (the highest I saw was 13 GB) and the Memory pressure goes red in the activity monitor. I had to force restart my Mac because of how unresponsive it was because of this.

Here's a photo of Activity Monitor ([https://imgur.com/a/rgQCwuV](https://imgur.com/a/rgQCwuV)). Ignore the blue highlighted row. Couldn't take a proper screenshot because the Mac completely glitched out.

The video I was viewing was [https://youtu.be/LXb3EKWsInQ](https://youtu.be/LXb3EKWsInQ) using 4k HDR.

Using **Chrome Stable** with the experimental feature for VP9 hardware decoding (#videotoolbox-vp9-decoding), this is ***not*** an issue with pretty much the same extensions.

&lt;p&gt;However, there seems to be memory leakage when using Edge when viewing 4K video. I&amp;#39;ve reported it to Microsoft, but I was wondering if anyone else is seeing it. &lt;strong&gt;VTDecoderXPCService&lt;/strong&gt; has used more than 7 GB of RAM (the highest I saw was 13 GB) and the Memory pressure goes red in the activity monitor. I had to force restart my Mac because of how unresponsive it was because of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a photo of Activity Monitor (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/rgQCwuV""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/rgQCwuV&lt;/a&gt;). Ignore the blue highlighted row. Couldn&amp;#39;t take a proper screenshot because the Mac completely glitched out.&lt;/p&gt;

Check those out to see what we\'ve worked on recently!\n\nSince our last update, in build [90.0.796.0](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/dev-channel-update-to-90-0-796-0-is-live/m-p/2140395), we talked about [an update to the Partner Center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/partner-center-improvements-related-to-microsoft-edge-extensions/m-p/2118981) for extension developers and asked IT Admins [how can we improve IE Mode](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/enterprise/requesting-feedback-on-internet-explorer-mode/m-p/2122301). We added the ability to start typing in search as soon as the new favorites and history flyouts are open, enabled single sign-on for Mac users, and fixed a few issues. In build [90.0.803.0](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/dev-channel-update-to-90-0-803-0-is-live/m-p/2160028), we added the ability to customize keyboard shortcuts in the DevTools, added in more work for the mini menu in PDFs, and fixed a printing issue where it failed and said that it ""can\'t calculate"". I highly encourage you to check out those change summaries to read about these changes and more, if you missed any of these updates.\n\nFor this week\'s update, we talk about [the update to the Extension hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-the-new-extensions-menu-on-the-toolbar/m-p/2179004), we have [updated our PDF roadmap](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/roadmap-for-pdf-reader-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/2175170), added sweet updates to the vertical tab pane ([INCLUDING RESIZING](https://www.reddit.com/r/edge/comments/lt64rr/in_the_latest_edge_canary_build_you_can_now/)), completed the work on the mini menu in PDFs, fixed a crash when printing multiple pages, fixed the profile error users were seeing - ""Some features not available. Something went wrong."", fixed some pinning/shortcut issues around PWAs, and fixed an incorrect message string when signing out of Edge. Several of these items were largely found thanks to you guys here on Reddit. Seriously, thank you. To read about these changes and more, click the **Change Summary** link below.\n\nIn your top feedback, we\'ve (for obvious reasons) moved several items from **Planned for February** to **March**, rolled back the status of one item as we continue work with internal partners, and added on two new things! One is about the ability to shrink the top title bar when using vertical tabs, and the other request is for enabling search in Collections. Both of these are currently under review by the team, and we\'ll provide updates on their statuses as we get them. Click on the **Top Feedback Summary** link below to read more about the updates to these items.\n\nThat\'s it for this week! You should see our Stable channel receive Edge 89 (and all it\'s goodies) this week, and in a couple weeks our Beta channel will see Edge 90 move into it.

,edge,"Hi.

I have seen that there are some people who can't get push notifications to work on some sites like Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube etc. Well, here we are going to solve that problem and to better understand how push notifications work in Edge I recommend you to read this [article](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/05/22/get-started-web-push-notifications-tutorial-demo/).

First of all, you have to verify in the site settings (Twitter, Reddit etc) that push notifications are enabled and if they are enabled you have to verify that notifications are allowed in the Edge settings. So in this post I will show you how to enable/allow push notifications from Twitter, Reddit, Youtube and Facebook. Let's get started.

&amp;#x200B;

**YOUTUBE.**

[In YouTube push notifications are enabled by default, but the video shows how to enable them manually.](https://i.redd.it/jq23hrj5xbk61.gif)

**TWITTER.**

[Like YouTube, push notifications are enabled by default, but the video shows how to enable them manually.](https://i.redd.it/r9yoewc2ybk61.gif)

**FACEBOOK.**

[For Facebook, push notifications are disabled and must be added to the Edge settings.](https://i.redd.it/z53gapqeybk61.gif)

**OLD REDDIT.**

[In the classic version of Reddit push notifications are enabled by default, I show how to enable them manually.](https://i.redd.it/eyokz6lozbk61.gif)

**NEW REDDIT.**

[Unlike the classic version, the new Reddit does not include some option for push notifications and like Facebook you have to add it to the Edge settings.](https://i.redd.it/2j56j5e40ck61.gif)

[In edge:\/\/settings\/content\/notifications you can manage the sites that send notifications.](https://preview.redd.it/fqyk426s3ck61.png?width=1084&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29891f9438ac3d96b182f3b0d8122443e5b002f5)

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see at the beginning of each video, I click on the padlock icon where it shows that there is nothing to indicate that notifications are allowed, only at the end you can it checks that it is enabled for each site. 

And by the way, not all sites have push notifications functionality as once said by moderator u/MSFTMissy in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/kbjluy/how_do_i_enable_desktop_push_notifications/). 

That's all. Let me know if the settings I showed for Facebook and Reddit (New) sites work. If not, hopefully an update to Edge will fix it.

Hi.

Have you ever wanted Edge to translate a page that is not in your native language but the translation icon simply does not appear even after refreshing the page? Well, I will show you how to force the translation of a web page in Edge without installing any extension.

The Edge browser comes with some built-in languages that you can see in edge://settings/languages, in my case it comes with 6 languages: Spanish (Latin America), English (United States), Spanish, Spanish (Spain), English and English (United Kingdom) as you can see in the following image:

[The three languages for Spanish have the same checkbox unchecked, this checkbox is sometimes unchecked by itself without being able to be activated from the configuration, resulting in not being able to translate any page that is not in my language.](https://preview.redd.it/383z4bcep4k61.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee1d646b5d3aeabef8062ce5eb2486b931ade2d8)

I speak Spanish, so Edge is configured with Spanish (Latin America) as the main language from which Edge should translate the page that is not in Spanish, but there is a problem, when the page translation icon does not appear the checkbox in charge of that action is disabled and grayed out, and the user cannot check that box which leaves the option 'Ask if I want to translate pages that are not in a language I can read' totally unusable even though it is checked.

So if you have already checked your language settings and you have reinstalled languages or moved them around and Edge still can't translate a page into your language, these two methods may help you.

**FIRST METHOD.**

I personally prefer this method because it is very easy and there is no data loss, just type edge://edge-urls/ in the address bar and scroll down the list to click on edge://translate-internals.

When you are inside edge://translate-internals you can see on the left a list of supported languages, just find your main language (the language from which you need Edge to translate a page to your language) and put the first two letters of that language in the Override field and click on the update button. After that just open any page that is not in your language and you will see that the translation icon now appears on every page you want to translate.

**SECOND METHOD.**

The second method involves a loss of data and like the first method is also easy, just go into the Edge settings and select the 'Reset settings' option, that will make the languages work fine again when you need to translate a page, but resetting the settings also involves resetting the home page, the search engine, extensions will be disabled and temporary data will be deleted, among other things.

**NOTE.** These two methods work well for a while, so when the translation icon disappears you know what to do.

Some time ago I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/edge/comments/lfl4qr/edge_has_a_serious_problem_when_i_want_it_to/) and the only answer I got did not convince me, so I searched the internet and found nothing, I discovered what is described here on my own and I want to share it with you.

,edge,"Hi.

There are several extensions with the PiP (Picture-in-Picture) function that allows you to watch a YouTube video in a floating window while browsing in other tabs. You can watch a video while working with the file explorer!. Google launched its own extension for PiP which you can find [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picture-in-picture-extens/hkgfoiooedgoejojocmhlaklaeopbecg?hl=en-US) but we don't need to install any extension to use Picture-in-Picture, we just need to activate the following flags:

https://preview.redd.it/8ivfeh3jxoj61.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4465bdb9f6ecc13949b6644b544579fd589a67f

After restarting the browser and opening any site that has videos, such as Youtube, Daylimotion, etc. a new icon will appear next to the address bar.

[The icon will appear when the video is playing and will disappear when the video has finished playing or when the tab containing the video has been closed.](https://preview.redd.it/fbyzr2932pj61.png?width=216&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d53c9a4804c02cd50c9ef6726d5dbad1b860a41)

[Watching a YouTube video while I'm on the Wikipedia page. The floating window can be resized by dragging it from a corner.](https://preview.redd.it/rtdk19k9ipj61.png?width=838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5c0e2d2937e94f53500c5ccdb8f915ae7588ea4)

[As you can see I have 3 video sites open and by clicking on the icon I can manage which video to pause, play or display PiP. The yellow box points to the icon to activate PiP on any video in the list.](https://preview.redd.it/fl4ucskhmpj61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b886f0fe8b6ed95793de378631d2e5db40b028c)

Another very useful function of which we do not need to install any extension is to create a Qr code for the page we are viewing, very useful if we share the page to a mobile device. To create a Qr code for the page, just activate the following flag:

https://preview.redd.it/s1x6aaqyspj61.png?width=741&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e3540b19f028e447d083f658d619eba653b5c7b

Once activated you can see how it works:

[Just click on the URL to bring up the Qr code icon and click on it to create the code.](https://i.redd.it/nutdi7fowpj61.gif)

And not only can you create a Qr code for the page you are on, you can also create a Qr code for any image.

[Right click on the image and click on Create QR code for this image. Easy!](https://i.redd.it/uscqdzbu2qj61.gif)

That's all, if you want to see the first part of 'No more extensions for these two useful functions' follow this [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/edge/comments/loguc8/no_more_extensions_for_these_two_useful_functions/)

NOTE: The QR code creation feature is enabled by default in the Dev version, so you don't have to enable the flag, what is shown here works in the latest stable version of Edge.

You can watch a video while working with the file explorer!. Google launched its own extension for PiP which you can find &lt;a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picture-in-picture-extens/hkgfoiooedgoejojocmhlaklaeopbecg?hl=en-US""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but we don&amp;#39;t need to install any extension to use Picture-in-Picture, we just need to activate the following flags:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/8ivfeh3jxoj61.png?width=740&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f4465bdb9f6ecc13949b6644b544579fd589a67f""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/8ivfeh3jxoj61.png?width=740&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f4465bdb9f6ecc13949b6644b544579fd589a67f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After restarting the browser and opening any site that has videos, such as Youtube, Daylimotion, etc. a new icon will appear next to the address bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/fbyzr2932pj61.png?width=216&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9d53c9a4804c02cd50c9ef6726d5dbad1b860a41""&gt;The icon will appear when the video is playing and will disappear when the video has finished playing or when the tab containing the video has been closed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/rtdk19k9ipj61.png?width=838&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f5c0e2d2937e94f53500c5ccdb8f915ae7588ea4""&gt;Watching a YouTube video while I&amp;#39;m on the Wikipedia page. The floating window can be resized by dragging it from a corner.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/fl4ucskhmpj61.png?width=1242&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6b886f0fe8b6ed95793de378631d2e5db40b028c""&gt;As you can see I have 3 video sites open and by clicking on the icon I can manage which video to pause, play or display PiP. The yellow box points to the icon to activate PiP on any video in the list.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very useful function of which we do not need to install any extension is to create a Qr code for the page we are viewing, very useful if we share the page to a mobile device. To create a Qr code for the page, just activate the following flag:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/s1x6aaqyspj61.png?width=741&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9e3540b19f028e447d083f658d619eba653b5c7b""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/s1x6aaqyspj61.png?width=741&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9e3540b19f028e447d083f658d619eba653b5c7b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once activated you can see how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.redd.it/nutdi7fowpj61.gif""&gt;Just click on the URL to bring up the Qr code icon and click on it to create the code.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not only can you create a Qr code for the page you are on, you can also create a Qr code for any image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.redd.it/uscqdzbu2qj61.gif""&gt;Right click on the image and click on Create QR code for this image. Easy!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all, if you want to see the first part of &amp;#39;No more extensions for these two useful functions&amp;#39; follow this &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/edge/comments/loguc8/no_more_extensions_for_these_two_useful_functions/""&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: The QR code creation feature is enabled by default in the Dev version, so you don&amp;#39;t have to enable the flag, what is shown here works in the latest stable version of Edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Day!&lt;/p&gt;

,edge,"Hi.

Like Chrome, we can customize Edge with color themes that look very nice and to see them we need to activate the following flag:

After activating the flag and restarting Edge, just go to the settings and select Appearance. Here you can see new accent themes to customize Edge.

[ As you can see, I currently have the orange theme enabled on my browser. ](https://preview.redd.it/7jtr44xg0hj61.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=237b115d1ac2db4944c690669231f21920cfb92c)

I use Edge Dev as my default browser, so this feature can be found in the Dev channel but not in the stable channel, for now. You can find more themes [here](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/microsoft-edge-themes)

,edge,"This is a new post to get attention on an issue I have been facing. I got some replies from /u/MSFTMissy initially, but after I gathered all the logs, I haven't heard anything since. 

Original text: 

I have been experiencing some weird issues with Edge, only when I am streaming Netflix. The issue is similar to https://www.reddit.com/r/edge/comments/k2tw8i/edge_freezes_during_video_playback_have_to/, but mine is for Netflix specifically.

During playback, if I double click to exit full screen mode, the chances of it stuttering, flickering is quite high - the Edge window would just be showing on and off in the process. Sometimes it just freezes Windows 10 completely, with audio continue playing in the background; The only way to fix this is to force shut down and restart the PC.

My PC is running on AMD X570, Ryzen 5 3600, GTX 1660Ti.

Today I decided to download some of my Facebook data (specifically my off-Facebook activity) and found that Microsoft Edge for Android has been sending my information to Facebook every time I opened the browser - these events have been matched by Facebook to my profile.

&amp;#x200B;

Microsoft have clearly implemented Facebook App Event Tracking which uses ""Facebook Advanced Matching"" to match your personal information with your Facebook profile (such as email address, name, phone number). Apart from the fact that Microsoft is providing Facebook your activity information, it allows Microsoft to, according to Facebook, "" observe how frequently users activate your app, how much time they spend using it, and view other demographic information through Facebook Analytics for Apps.""

&amp;#x200B;

Is this sort of tracking deceptive when Microsoft themselves state ""Tracking prevention is designed to protect you from being tracked by websites that you aren’t accessing directly""?

Obviously, in the first three options, **the tabs only start to shrink once the tab strip is full,** until then, the tabs keep their normal width.

Wouldn't it be nice if we had an option to choose the tab width that best suits our needs?

Chrome once had a function to return to the previous page by pressing the Backspace key, but that function was removed in Chrome version 52.

After this function was removed, extensions began to appear to re-enable it, and even Google also released its own extension called [Go Back With Backspace](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/go-back-with-backspace/eekailopagacbcdloonjhbiecobagjci), but in Edge we do not need to install any extension to enable this function, we just have to activate the following flag:

Another useful function of which we do not need to install any extension is called Link to text snippet, that lets you generate URLs to specific text on a webpage, regardless of the page’s formatting.  For example, clicking this [link](https://www.theverge.com/21288970/sony-ps5-playstation-5-announcement-analysis-graphics-games#GNaFeX:~:text=And%20that%E2%80%99s%20completely%20fine.%20Sony%E2%80%99s%20presentation,the%20PS5%20to%20be%20any%20different) in Chrome or Edge will bring you directly to a highlighted section at the bottom of the article. 

Google also has its own extension called [Link to Text Fragment](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/link-to-text-fragment/pbcodcjpfjdpcineamnnmbkkmkdpajjg?hl=en-US) for this function, but we don't need to install any extension to enable this function, we just have to activate the following flag:

The add-on has been removed from the store and I uninstalled it. It was https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/nordvpn/nnodnaklcgaogphkbecinleilepmjekl 

I did some checking and I found an older post -  [Edge injecting ads into search results?](https://www.reddit.com/r/edge/comments/jtdg2t/edge_injecting_ads_into_search_results/) \- that mentions there were malicious add-ons removed late last year, however the path and behaviour of this one is not the same.

My PC is Windows 10 and it was the latest stable version of Edge. I have run Windows security scans as well as Malwarebytes and McAfee scans but nothing was found. 

After installing the add-on I didn't notice any of the behaviour mentioned with the other add-ons (e.g. search redirects, pop-ups) or any suspicious behaviour I can recall, so I was wondering if anyone knew what kind of threat this add-on posed?

Also, I use two different profiles on Edge but I only installed the add-on on one of them. Would the profile without the add-on have been vulnerable too?

,edge,"Hi.

In Edge Legacy there was a feature that when you hovered over a tab, a thumbnail of the tab would appear.

For me personally it is something very useful, because if you open any page in a new tab you have to wait and see how it loads its content, but with the preview function you can switch to another open tab and let the page continue loading and if you hover over the tab that is loading you can see in the preview if it has already loaded its content or just a thumbnail of the page already loaded.

As I said before it was an Edge Legacy feature, but you can also have it in Edge Chromium, just enable the following flags:

It is the same function that we see when we pass the cursor over an icon of an open program in the Windows taskbar.

,edge,"Hi all,

I'm encountering a weird quirk and I'm curious to know if I'm the only one seeing it.

If I use tab groups with Edge, the outline doesn't seem to draw ""smoothly"" for lack of a better word. See the picture below, specifically, the bottom corners of the active tabs. It looks like there's an extra row of pixels that's a lighter colour.

Compare this to Chrome where the line is drawn seamlessly.

It looks even worse if the active tab isn't the last one. You can see some poor drawing along the right edge.

,edge,"This may be an unpopular opinion but I am actually a big fan of side-scrolling.  In certain cases...

Dang, it Microsoft at least allow us a choice between whether or not to implement the new changes for UI or not. An extra slider would have been nice instead you remove a good feature and don't give us the ability to bring it back. I always used edge to view pdf's since it was actually better than chrome function-wise for pdf viewing mainly because of the side scroll and better scaling.

&amp;#x200B;

The latest edition of edge has ruined that:

Why would I want 1/3 of the next slide peeking into my window on whatever I am trying to read.

A. Distracting

B. Not functional for slides of different sizes.

C. I used to digest two pages at a time now I have 2 pages and 4 imp pages invading my personal space.

Please add more sliders under page-view so I can choose when to implement the new functionality when it is actually convenient to what I am using it for.

&amp;#x200B;

So I give you this, two main reasons to implement the above changes,

1. Sheet Music. Being able to quickly change pages and view side by side is important to a musician. I have seen posts about this alone.
2. Tablets using remote connect. People tend to want to swipe like a book I still haven't tested this implementation yet.
3. My usage case where I get distracted easily due to my ADHD.  And side by side top scrolling is very distracting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong if you remove any of the new features I will be equally mad.  My own recommendation would be to split up edge into both the pdf viewing aspect and the web browser in order to please those concerned with the fastest experience possible. And offer the extra pdf features as extras that can be added on independently.

Hello community, I need your help.

In the Edge configuration, in its language section, Edge comes with six languages. These languages came by default with Edge, I have not added or removed any language:

* Spanish (Latin America)
* Spanish
* Spanish (Spain)
* English
* English (United Kingdom)
* English (United States)

Finally, the option **Ask if I want to translate pages that are not in a language I can read** is always active.

When I click on the three dots that appear on the right side of each language, the checkbox *Show Microsoft Edge in this language* I only have it active for the first language in the list. And the *Offer translation of pages in this language* checkbox is active and grayed out for the last 3 languages in the list.

I speak Spanish and with the settings I mentioned before the translate pages icon appears from time to time on pages that are in English or some other different language, and other times it just doesn't appear when I need it. 

I should point out that when the icon no longer appears for most of the pages I want to see translated, I have to reset Edge settings to their defaults to get the translate function working again, but it only works fine for a while and then I have to reset Edge again. 

This is a big problem, so is there any way to force the translation of web pages or make the icon always appear for the pages I want Edge to translate?

,edge,"**On 21 November 2020 the new favourite manager has been made available on the stable channel but little has been improved from when it was first introduced**

Here are some of the issues that I'd like to see addressed all of which reported with the feedback tool months ago

* ~~Clicking the favourite manager button again reinvokes rather than closes it~~ - **addressed**

* ~~The right click context menu is out of view sometimes~~ - **addressed**

* It doesn't retain the folder collapse/expand state - **partially addressed (works inconsistently)**

* Clicking the add favourite/folder icon does not make it scroll/jump directly to the newly created favourite/folder requiring the user to manually look for it

* Favourites that are dragged into a folder are still placed at the top rather than bottom. Cannot be replicated on stock Chromium. Reported with the feedback tool in 2019

* It doesn't let you manage multiple favourites by holding ctrl

* It doesn't retain the pinned state

* It goes completely blank when scrolling through many favourites at once

* It has a second nested scroll bar sometimes

* It offers no way to adjust the width while pinned and there is no vertical scroll bar (rip nested folders and long names)

* It remains on screen with a video playing in full screen while pinned

* It takes 1+ second to open with many favourites saved

* The previously planned 'Provide different options for sorting favourites' was secretly removed from the [feedback summary list](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/top-feedback-summary-for-october-20/m-p/1800828) and marked as addressed

* The right click context menu remains open sometimes with no way to close it other than to reinvoke the favourite manager

* The right click context menu takes 1+ second to open and lacks the animation that can be seen everywhere else

* The scroll bar is tiny and cannot be grabbed from the very edge

,edge,"First and foremost keep in mind that this workaround ***can stop working at any moment***, Microsoft ***could*** eventually make the old menus stop working in Edge, so take this as something ***temporary*** while Microsoft refines the new flyouts.

To disable the new menus you have to use one of the shortcuts, first create one and then right click on it, then click on ""Properties"" and, at the end of the **target** field, you have to add this:

**--disable-features=msHub**

Since some users already have the new flyout menus in Edge stable, this is the full path in that version:

""C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe"" **--disable-features=msHub**

[**Shortcut properties.**](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/943c0dd51225e0fb8e27b1234b9662364af2dedb8aafaeff81143c674cc2a082.png)

Beta:

""C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Edge Beta\\Application\\msedge.exe"" **--disable-features=msHub**

Dev:

""C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Edge Dev\\Application\\msedge.exe"" **--disable-features=msHub**

This will disable ***all the flyout menus.***

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to disable only one of the menus, you have to add the following at the end of the target field:

**--disable-features=msHistoryHub**

**--disable-features=msDownloadsHub**

**--disable-features=msCollectionsHub**

**--disable-features=msExtensionsHub**  


Note: ***It seems*** that the favorites flyout cannot be disabled ***individually.***

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, if you want to disable two or three flyouts at the same time, you just have to add a comma after each of the flags, something like this:

**--disable-features=msCollectionsHub,msHistoryHub**

&amp;#x200B;

As I said before, this is temporary and you better try to get used to the new menus.

The menu in Edge has some small differences with respect to Chrome's menu:

&amp;#x200B;

* The ""Show or hide from toolbar"" icons are different.
* A new ""Find new extensions"" option has been added (this option takes you to Edge's Add-ons page.
* The extensions section in the toolbar is separate from the other buttons (toolbar separator).
* And of course, unlike Chrome, Edge allows you to hide the button from the toolbar.

&lt;p&gt;Full path in Dev:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Edge Dev\Application\msedge.exe&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;--enable-features=msExtensionsHub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full path in Canary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge SxS\Application\msedge.exe&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;--enable-features=msExtensionsHub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more complete guide on this procedure, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/eqnwyi/how_to_enable_the_collections_feature_in_the/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;please visit this post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The menu in Edge has some small differences with respect to Chrome&amp;#39;s menu:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;quot;Show or hide from toolbar&amp;quot; icons are different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new &amp;quot;Find new extensions&amp;quot; option has been added (this option takes you to Edge&amp;#39;s Add-ons page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The extensions section in the toolbar is separate from the other buttons (toolbar separator).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And of course, unlike Chrome, Edge allows you to hide the button from the toolbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the current look of the menu in Edge Canary, but Edge developers could make other changes to it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/xpo6g4nk6rd61.png?width=595&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6b2940222387510c34dee9598e3a59233b515678""&gt;For reference, this is Chrome&amp;#39;s extensions toolbar menu.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Hangout Extension worked perfectly on Edge up until I want to say 2-3 days ago? For whatever reason, I can no longer make or receive calls from the Google Hangouts Extension.

I am using the latest stable version of Edge (88.0.705.50) and I can confirm that the ""Tab groups collapse"" feature has finally arrived for the stable version, and is available as a flag.

Although the ""Tab groups"" function is already available (as a flag) we know that it is useless to have, for example, 30 open tabs grouped by groups if the group label is also taking up space in the tab bar.

So to make life easier for us the new Edge update in the stable channel came with two new flags with the expected tab group collapsing feature.

,edge,"Hello,  


We've been using Edge as the default browser across our organization now for some time (mobile + desktop). We are heavily invested in Azure and have setup policies from Intune/Endpoint for each platform. We also use Azure App Proxy for some internal apps and it has been working pretty fine (except for some services that have weird requirements around ports and what not). On mobile, App Proxy Redirection policy is setup (through App Configuration Policies) to automatically translate Intranet links to their ""App Proxy"" equivalents. This works perfectly fine with Edge on Android and iOS. On desktop though, I'm having issues understanding how it works.  


I believe I remember (not 100% sure) Edge on desktop being able to automatically translate Intranet URLs to their App Proxy counterparts. In fact, Microsoft mentions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-configure-hard-coded-link-translation): 

&gt;You can use Microsoft Edge to further protect your application and content. To use this solution, you need to require/recommend users access the application through Microsoft Edge. All internal URLs published with Application Proxy will be recognized by Edge and redirected to the corresponding external URL. This ensures that all the hard-coded internal URLs work, and if a user goes to the browser and directly types the internal URL, it works even if the user is remote. 

It then links to configuration for iOS and Android, but nothing about desktop Edge. I cannot find anything in Configuration Profiles for Windows about this feature. I just tested the ""My Apps"" extension, which does work, but I'm pretty sure it used to work until recently without this. Also, the redirection isn't very smart, as in it doesn't check if the Intranet link is accessible or not and just automatically redirects everything to App Proxy even when on Intranet.  


Am I missing something? Am I crazy or this really use to work and now doesn't without the extension (and works poorly when it does with it)?

I like Edge Chromium, I have been using it for many months and it is the only browser on my PC, but now I want to uninstall it completely.

So what I want to know is if I can completely uninstall the stable version of Edge Chromium, because I want to replace it with Edge Dev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do you know how to do it without Windows 10 presenting errors? Is possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;

,edge,"Hi

I use Edge with bing as my search engine, however when i search using the bar at the top it quickly redirects me to [blacksearch.org](https://blacksearch.org) followed by a link (looks like this: [Blacksearch.org](https://Blacksearch.org)\[websitelink\] ), and then sends me to the bing results page.

\*This only happens when I search from the top bar, and do not provide a full link, (eg youtube, gmail, ect instead of [youtube.com](https://youtube.com) or [Gmail.com](https://Gmail.com) ect.)

I have not asked edge to do this, and I have removed any other possible search engine from the list in the settings, yet it still redirects me through it.

I can upload screenshots if required.

is this now a normal feature of edge or is something wrong?

,edge," On the latest version of Edge, I can enable the Extensions Toolbar Menu by adding ""--enable-features=ExtensionsToolbarMenu"" parameter to the shortcut target pinned to the start menu and to the taskbar.  


However, when launching Edge from saved URLs (both internetshortcut and IE.Assoc.File.URL types) -- by this I mean opening URL files either taken from IE Favorites folder and saved to another folder or dragged out of Edge bookmark manager creating a URL file and NOT from within the bookmark manager, Edge is launched without the extension toolbar enabled. Apparently, these URL files launch Edge without addons enabled.  


How do I open saved URL files to open Edge WITH parameters? I cannot modify the msedge.exe file with a parameter.  
Do I need to modify something in the registry regarding URL/internetshortcut/IE.Assoc.File.URL?  


Or, better yet, how would I add an Open With menu to saved URL files to open in a browser with parameters?

,edge,"Hopefully there is a solution to this.

So we have Windows Hello for Business deployed at our office. It works great for domain joined computers. No complains there.

The issue I am running into is.... say I have a local web server and I access it using its local IP address via EDGE. I get the Windows Hello prompt and even though the webserver (a Synology NAS to be exact) is joined to the domain, it itself doesn't support Windows Hello. So it doesn't sign in, I have to hit ""Cancel"" on the prompt and then login to the webserver using my Synology credentials or my full domain login w/ password.

My questions.

1. Can this be fixed so it WILL work with non Windows webservers?
2. If NOT, can Windows Hello Prompt be removed from EDGE so it doesn't even try this option first?

,edge,"Hello everyone, 

I'm having the following issue (image attached). I'm seeing black squares when I should see the actual images. I tried reinstalling Edge, disabling all the extensions and scanning for corrupt files in my system. Nothing seems to fix it but disabling hardware acceleration. I want to have hardware acceleration enabled, though. I also tried clearing the cache. Any ideas of what's going on? If I try opening this sites on Chrome or Firefox, everything is displayed correctly. 

Thank you all and happy Holidays!

I'm struggling a lot with this problem, the monospaced texts in various websites show up using the ""Coder's Crux""  font, even though I never put it in edge settings, the default font is ""Consolas"", but the texts appear using ""Coder's Crux"".

I tried:

1. Reset settings to default.
2. Uninstall Coder's Crux from the computer.
3. Delete the .ttf file.
4. Restart the Browser.
5. Restart the Computer.
6. Change windows font settings.
7. Reinstall Edge

None of this worked, I'm really considering to format the computer.

Strangely it only seems to affect some of the text and not the whole document.  Highlighting the text with my mouse cursor corrects the issue.  I have Windows scaling set to 125% in the display settings on a 1440p monitor which may/may not be the cause.

,edge,"I did a manual update about an hour ago through the edge://settings/help page.After Edge restart it won't open in any way.I did try Edge beta, same issue.

Downloaded Edge Canary and it is working for now but since this is my production device I can't have it as a production browser.

Did anyone else encounter such a issue?

Thank you

**Update**

As [Smooth-Lee](https://www.reddit.com/user/Smooth-Lee/) pointed out and [MSFTMissy](https://www.reddit.com/user/MSFTMissy/) confirmed this seems to have happened on my production device because of a false positive detection from **Trend Micro OfficeScan Agent.** Updating the agent seemed to have solved the issue.

,edge,"To make it simple: When you have DPI scaling turned on the browser respects it and scales everything up to match. This means, for example, that a 200% DPI scaling setting on Windows makes the browser scale everything (including its UI) 200% as well (it's the same as zooming 200%).   


This makes perfect sense when you're showing a complete page. But it doesn't when you just want to look at a single image. Since you have to scale images up to make their resolutions big enough in order to place them properly in a scaled page, upscaling them there makes absolute sense. Upscaling the image when it is the only thing being displayed in the tab does not, it only makes it blurrier (and bigger) for no reason whatsoever since you're not trying to fit it anywhere.  


Is there any way to make Edge ignore DPI scaling when opening images? (Mostly pages ending in .png, .jpg, .gif or .webp).   


I use a simple Greasemonkey script to achieve this on Firefox:

var factor = 1/window.devicePixelRatio;  

document.querySelector('body &gt; img').style.transform = 'scale(' + factor + ')';

From my understanding this should work just fine on Tampermonkey, but it doesn't. It scales the image once when you open it, but then stops doing anything after you zoom-in or out (in the case the image can't fit in the window, the default behaviour is to downscale it until it fits).",t2_upwuu,False,,0,False,Make Edge stop scaling images when DPI scaling is turned on if the images are open in their own tabs.,[],r/edge,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k5evw4,False,dark,0.72,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},QUESTION,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,,1606961996.0,text,6,,,text,self.edge,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make it simple: When you have DPI scaling turned on the browser respects it and scales everything up to match.

,edge,"\*\*Microsoft Edge is up to date.\*\*Version 87.0.664.47 (Official build) (64-bit)

I'm using Edge Chromium (Blink engine I believe), and lately it is taking up huge amounts of system resources on startup, pegging my 8 core 16 thread CPU at 100% usage for over a minute after startup. As you can see it's using no small amount of memory either. At one point last week it consumed as much as 32GB memory, and likely would have consumed more, had I not killed it in task manager.

Now I currently have just over 100 tabs open (113 to be exact) and I have noticed after it calms down, I can click on any tab and the tab will display fully loaded instantly. But this is not a good thing. I did not tell those tabs to load. Somehow, Edge must be loading all 100+ of my tabs on browser launch. I scoured the settings but could not find an option to set tabs to only load when clicked on.

A separate issue I've also noticed - when pressing alt tab to switch between Edge &amp; other software, the alt-tab menu will bring up multiple Edge tabs. How would one go about disabling this? I only want a single instance of Edge in the alt-tab display.

&amp;#x200B;

[Three-dimensional rendering of some of the new Fluent icons \(Image by Cody Sorgenfrey\).](https://preview.redd.it/crzfa9urmuz51.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=756b554e44da805233bf78935cb6c31319cc07a6)

**Hello Edge Insider community!**

We recently released the first of many visual updates we have planned for Edge as we modernize and evolve our design language. First, we’re focusing on our core system iconography which hasn’t been updated since the days of our second Microsoft Design Language (MDL2), circa 2014. This has been a Microsoft-wide design initiative and it was important for Edge to be early adopters of the new, open-source [Fluent Design System](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/developing-an-open-source-icon-system-at-microsoft-b1796315df9f) icons which were announced at the 2020 Build conference. This effort covers more than two hundred icons, many of which have been custom made for Edge.

&amp;#x200B;

The new icon system builds off the visual design updates first seen in our refreshed [Microsoft app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYmTkgqbrDM&amp;feature=emb_title) icons, which includes the latest Edge logo. We’re now rolling out the first of 2 phases to update the app iconography. This phase will impact many of our high-touch user interfaces, including tabs, address bar, as well as navigational and wayfinding icons found in our various menus.

[Side-by-side comparison of the Edge browser frame with the old and new icons \(Image by Cody Sorgenfrey\).](https://preview.redd.it/n0wp47ktnuz51.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1436b1a18cfd0a80d8cbdf7bd62660fd258482b)

There were many reasons we felt this effort was worth our attention, but most notably our motivations were to start modernizing the look &amp; feel of the user interface. The new Fluent iconography system provides functional optimizations for user experience as each icon is based on a standard keyline and grid. This will improve scannability as you browse menus and navigation. We’ve also seen optimized rendering across platforms and devices so no matter which device you’re browsing the web on the icons will appear sharp and easy to read. Lastly, if you’re a Microsoft 365 user you’ll start to see more coherence between Edge and other great products you probably already use, such as Outlook for iOS and Android where these icons are already in use.

[ Three-dimensional rendering of a blue refresh icon with rounded caps \(Image by Cody Sorgenfrey\). ](https://preview.redd.it/grk6nrdlouz51.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a09643979bc7681bb17afbe58aa33bc5a50ff967)

The next phase of this work will cover the remaining product surfaces that aren’t being covered in phase one, which are Developer Tools and our Extension experience. Additional to iconography, we know that there are many elements that represent Fluent design. Over the next few months we’ll be actively exploring ways that we can create a more beautiful, expressive, moving, browsing experiences for all our users. Our goal is to make something unique to browsers, while delivering a modern look and feel that matches Microsoft 365 and our brand personality. We hope you’ll love the new iconography as much as we do, and as always please share your thoughts with us so we can continue to improve and evolve.

This effort covers more than two hundred icons, many of which have been custom made for Edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new icon system builds off the visual design updates first seen in our refreshed &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYmTkgqbrDM&amp;amp;feature=emb_title""&gt;Microsoft app&lt;/a&gt; icons, which includes the latest Edge logo. We’re now rolling out the first of 2 phases to update the app iconography. This phase will impact many of our high-touch user interfaces, including tabs, address bar, as well as navigational and wayfinding icons found in our various menus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/n0wp47ktnuz51.png?width=999&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c1436b1a18cfd0a80d8cbdf7bd62660fd258482b""&gt;Side-by-side comparison of the Edge browser frame with the old and new icons (Image by Cody Sorgenfrey).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many reasons we felt this effort was worth our attention, but most notably our motivations were to start modernizing the look &amp;amp; feel of the user interface. The new Fluent iconography system provides functional optimizations for user experience as each icon is based on a standard keyline and grid. This will improve scannability as you browse menus and navigation. We’ve also seen optimized rendering across platforms and devices so no matter which device you’re browsing the web on the icons will appear sharp and easy to read. Lastly, if you’re a Microsoft 365 user you’ll start to see more coherence between Edge and other great products you probably already use, such as Outlook for iOS and Android where these icons are already in use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/grk6nrdlouz51.png?width=999&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a09643979bc7681bb17afbe58aa33bc5a50ff967""&gt; Three-dimensional rendering of a blue refresh icon with rounded caps (Image by Cody Sorgenfrey). &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next phase of this work will cover the remaining product surfaces that aren’t being covered in phase one, which are Developer Tools and our Extension experience. Additional to iconography, we know that there are many elements that represent Fluent design. Over the next few months we’ll be actively exploring ways that we can create a more beautiful, expressive, moving, browsing experiences for all our users. Our goal is to make something unique to browsers, while delivering a modern look and feel that matches Microsoft 365 and our brand personality. We hope you’ll love the new iconography as much as we do, and as always please share your thoughts with us so we can continue to improve and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

We're [improving notifications and badges on PWAs](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/improving-notifications-and-badging-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/1873402), have [a new feature for shopping](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-shopping-with-microsoft-edge/m-p/1870080) coming (some of you have noticed this), you can now [share favorites between different browser profiles](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/feature-spotlight-steps-for-sharing-favorites/m-p/1858853), and if you're a Canary user [we're trying to gather more details for a bug](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/are-you-seeing-a-welcome-page-when-you-update-canary-read-more/m-p/1850249) we caught.\n\nIn blog updates, we talk about [memory usage again](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/jscjvk/how_microsoft_edge_and_other_applications_manage/), [an update to the work features](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/jngwh8/new_updates_make_microsoft_edge_your_daily/) of the new tab page, and [safety and privacy features](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/jngvxd/safety_and_privacy_in_microsoft_edge/) that helps keep you safe online.\n\nWe have a new issue being added this week. The team is aware that users on our Linux channel are unable to install the Microsoft Editor extension. We're investigating, and I'll let you all know once this has been resolved. If you spot any other extension issues on Linux, please report it directly through the browser via **Alt+Shift+I.** \n\nThere's a few neat things that came into this update, despite it being a smaller update. You can now pin a website to the Start menu (an Edge legacy feature), enable support for guided switch on Macs, and added the ability for Kiosk Mode to open all popups in new tabs instead of windows. We've also fixed a few crash-related bugs and issues, so be sure to check out Josh's change summary by clicking that link below.\n\nTop Feedback is super quiet this week with only one update: We have an alternative planned for set aside tabs. That's it!\n\nThe team will be taking breaks for the upcoming US holidays. This means breaks in updates, as well. There will be no updates the week of Thanksgiving, or the last two weeks of December. I'll be sure to remind y'all as we get closer to these dates, too!\n\nEven though this update to the browser itself was smaller, we definitely have a ton of content from the past week that you can check out. If haven't already, we suggest downloading one of our Insider channels via the link below so you can have access to these changes earlier than they hit Stable! I'll chat at you all next week. :D \n\n \n\n[Change Summary](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/dev-channel-update-to-88-0-692-0-is-live/m-p/1873631)\n\n[Top Feedback Summary](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/top-feedback-summary-for-november-10/m-p/1873632)\n\n[Download the Insider builds here](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/download/)"", 'author_fullname': 't2_5956yded', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Dev channel update to 88.0.692.0 is now live!', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/MicrosoftEdge', 'collections': [{'permalink': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/collection/d8e96cce-fb8f-4843-a8bd-97fc7862770e', 'link_ids': ['t3_f7gicy', 't3_fa1hdl', 't3_fdlhct', 't3_fta9ts', 't3_fws84f', 't3_g1g78p', 't3_g5r0lx', 't3_g9v7d1', 't3_ge46xg', 't3_ginh2j', 't3_gmvu9j', 't3_gsd83z', 't3_h0kyk6', 't3_hfc6om', 't3_hk7qkn', 't3_hrtbm1', 't3_hvcqwf', 't3_hzm0a4', 't3_i4y3gu', 't3_i8l01f', 't3_icujpa', 't3_iht76p', 't3_ikpoge', 't3_iq99ih', 't3_itikqs', 't3_j6va5q', 't3_jewvfn', 't3_jnhaxw', 't3_jsdf0s', 't3_jw01nd', 't3_kdt6eh', 't3_krxsfs', 't3_kw0iec', 't3_l6cgs7', 't3_lb4fox', 't3_lgazei', 't3_lx23se', 't3_m1dzq2', 't3_m6h3h0'], 'description': '', 'title': 'Dev Channel Updates', 'created_at_utc': 1582314125.977, 'subreddit_id': 't5_381b7', 'author_name': 'MSFTMissy', 'collection_id': 'd8e96cce-fb8f-4843-a8bd-97fc7862770e', 'author_id': 't2_5956yded', 'last_update_utc': 1615922645.62, 'display_layout': None}], 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_jsdf0s', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.91, 'author_flair_background_color': '', 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 16, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 16, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'Edge CM 🍰'}], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1605147482.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'richtext', 'domain': 'self.MicrosoftEdge', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, friends!

Im looking for this exact policy for new edge as I am in need of this for our kiosks

I think its for old edge though. Only judging from the location of the policy ""Windows Components"" folder

Downloaded and installed the latest admx templates ( date modified 4/11/2020) so they are very very new

Cannot find the policy at all

* --kiosk-idle-timeout-minutes  
 : Change the time (in minutes) from the last user activity before Microsoft Edge kiosk mode resets the user's session. The following values are supported:

   * Allowed values

,edge,"I’ve been having trouble updating Microsoft Edge to the latest version on my Mac. Each time I try to update, on the Microsoft autoupdate window the update for Edge gets stuck on installing (see picture). I’ve restarted my machine, uninstalled and reinstalled both Microsoft Edge and the Microsoft autoupdate and I still get this problem. I’ve never had a problem with updating Microsoft apps via the Microsoft autoupdate before this.

The only workaround I have is reinstalling the newest version of edge but that's incredibly annoying to do each time I want to upgrade.

A couple weeks ago [I ran a poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/edge/comments/jgviif/community_feedback_requested_post_flair_edition/) looking to see how you all felt about the post flair suggestions I want to implement. Overwhelmingly, you all liked what I suggested. There were a couple of other suggestions from you all, including MEME and NEW FEATURE.

With that, here's the options that will be available for post flairs:

* NEW FEATURE
* BUG
* GENERAL
* FEATURE FEEDBACK (for when you have *feedback* about a feature)
* QUESTION (for when you have a *question* about a feature)
* OFFICIAL (for Microsoft Employee use)
* MEME

These should cover every different topic that everyone posts in this subreddit. If you feel I am forgetting something, let me know! I'll put it up to a vote to the community and see if they agree with you; whether it's implemented or not will be dependent on that.

Thanks again to everyone who voted and offered their own thoughts! You should see these rolling out today, but please let me know if you have any questions or concerns! :3

You will know when you should be seeing those by default when I update the Top Feedback Summary with marking those two items as Addressed.\n\nSpeaking of that, this week we marked the ability to the favorites to the side of the screen as **Addressed** after the [introduction of the new way to manage favorites](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-the-new-favorites-experience-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/1780521). You can expect to start seeing text notes available in PDFs this month, and [in December](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/top-feedback-summary-for-october-29/m-p/1834898) you can expect to start seeing the option to prevent auto-play when you open a website and more top sites on the new tab page. Additionally, the team is currently reviewing feedback around matching the display language in Windows, which was newly added to the top feedback list last week. \n\nThere hasn't been much in the way of changes and improvements over the past couple weeks, but check out Josh's change summary by clicking the link below if you want to read about what this week's release looks like.\n\nThat's all for this week! If you haven't given them a shot already, and are itching to try out vertical tabs or history sync, download our Canary or Dev channel today by clicking the link below to the Insider builds! We want to know your thoughts on these features that we bring to you, and the best way to do that is as early as we implement them through Insider channels.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/nlcaxsj0wqw51.png?width=2230&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c6e0c8ae6dff44b07665b7e8018b4fd95f6361ef""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/nlcaxsj0wqw51.png?width=2230&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c6e0c8ae6dff44b07665b7e8018b4fd95f6361ef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I guess I just can&amp;#39;t register as a individual developer. So in that case could anyone with a valid account help me to upload a browser extension that I made?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project link: &lt;a href=""https://github.com/revir/dictionaries""&gt;https://github.com/revir/dictionaries&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a small video to demo it. &lt;/p&gt;

,edge,"Hi Edge-community,

the subject of this post describes my problem really well.

&amp;#x200B;

In our environment a group policy is set up to assign the ""Enterprise Site List"" with the sites that needs to be opened in the ""IE Mode"". Everything is working so far. 

Now after updating the Edge to the newest version we face the following situation:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Open Edge 
2. Browse an IE Mode site (working)
3. Edge stays open 30min to 1 hour 
4. Browse an IE Mode site (not working anymore)

Maybe someone is also facing this particular issue.

Thanks in advance if someone has a solution!

Kind regards,

For example, when you click on a YouTube link, instead of opening in a new browser tab, it will open in YouTube's PWA:

&amp;#x200B;

It works in PWAs developed by the site owner (like Twitter, Outlook, Spotify, etc.) and also in those sites that can be installed as apps.

This is just an experiment so it still doesn't work well.

It only works in [*tabbed PWAs*](https://www.reddit.com/r/edge/comments/jfj119/microsoft_has_added_the_necessary_flag_to_enable/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)*.*

It doesn't work in native Windows apps such as Mail, if you send an email that contains a link associated with a PWA, the link opens in the browser.

You can't choose which apps open automatically when clicking a link and which don't, but ***I guess*** that will be added later:

,edge,"Vertical tabs have been getting a lot of attention so I figured I'd provide feedback on the ""Scrollable tabstrip"" feature, available in version 88 and higher (as of now only in Dev and Canary).

Right now the feature is still hidden behind a launch argument and I'm not sure if the dev team has any plans for it, but it's a really important feature for me and I imagine a lot of people coming from Firefox.

&amp;nbsp;

**Functionality**

- When opening a new tab from a link, it would be more convenient if the tabstrip automatically scrolled to the right until that tab is visible. Right now you have to scroll to see newly opened tabs, and I'm finding myself constantly scrolling to the right as I browse just to see links I just clicked on

- Similarly, having the ""new tab"" (+) button be always visible at the end of the tabstrip would be a welcomed change (untie it from the right-most tab when tab scrolling starts, so that the button doesn't disappear when you scroll tabs to the left)

- The tabstrip should stay in place for a couple seconds (or preferably until you move the cursor off the tabstrip) after closing a tab before rearranging/resizing when you're on the right extremity of the tabstrip, to make closing several tabs a lot easier and frustration free. Right now if you're all the way to the right of the tabstrip and you close a tab, the tabstrip instantly scrolls back and the mouse pointer isn't aligned with the ""close tab"" (X) button of the new current tab

&amp;nbsp;

**Visibility of tab titles**

This is more subjective, but I think the minimum tab width should be a bit larger when the scrollable tabstrip is enabled, as the current minimum width sort of defeats the purpose of the feature a little. Right now on the current tab you barely even see half of the first letter of the title because of the space taken by the ""close tab"" button, and on a tab with audio playing you don't see the icon or a single letter.

Making the minimum tab width 6-10 pixels larger and/or reducing the space between the tab icon and the title by a few pixels would allow you to see a few more letters and I think it would be a good trade-off overall

&amp;nbsp;

**Smoothness and overall feel**

Right now with no animated transition and the rather short travel per scroll step, tab scrolling feels very snappy and fast when you don't have that many tabs open (say 27-40), but when you start having more, the short distance per scroll step starts to become impractical.
A little more travel per scroll step along with a very fast animated transition (with no transition you'd ""jump"" between too many tabs at once) could make tab scrolling feel better on average

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;I believe these changes would really improve the feature a lot and I&amp;#39;d love to see them happen, Edge Chromium is shaping up very nicely and this would make it even better for me. Thank you for all the work that goes into it!&lt;/p&gt;

,edge,"Hey, everyone! I've mentioned in the past that there are some changes I'd love to see in this subreddit to make it a bit more organized. I'm now starting that process and want your input!

Three months ago, [it was requested](https://www.reddit.com/r/edge/comments/hw79w3/it_would_be_great_to_be_able_to_have_the_flair_in/) that we require post flair on every post in this sub and I have some thoughts on the options to make available for you. I think these cover everything, but I'm also curious if you have other ideas on what options we should have! Here's what I have so far:

* PSA (which can be used by users who are talking about new features they discovered in the browser, shoutout to Leo who continuously does this)
* BUG (self-explanatory, I hope)
* FEATURE FEEDBACK (for when you have *feedback* about a feature)
* QUESTION (for when you have a *question* about a feature)
* GENERAL (if want to talk with your fellow community members, this is how!)
* OFFICIAL (to be used by me for posts from the team/blog posts)

I've also considered requiring items like the OS or device type or what channel someone is using so that the community can understand up front where the issue is happening. My thought is that I make these required words in a title of a post, but then that would interfere with say the GENERAL post flair where members may just be talking to each other.

I did, just today, implement posting guidelines when you go to create a post. You can [see what it says here](https://i.imgur.com/5LgklpK.png) without making a post, but it's encouraging posters to include the OS, device, or channel, so this may answer my concerns about the text requirements in the title.

Let me know what you think! The poll is open for a week, but I'd love to talk more together about this in the comments. Thanks for helping make this community the best it can be! :3

&lt;p&gt;As I said &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/edge/comments/j81z8o/new_tab_button_no_longer_extend_to_the_top_edge/g8ar5db?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;in another comment&lt;/a&gt;, I don&amp;#39;t know if Edge developers will merge the fix of this bug &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;into the stable version&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some posts that mention this bug:&lt;/p&gt;

This week is our last Edge 87 update we're releasing to our Dev channel, and it's got some good things showing up! One important thing to note is for users who have their **On startup** options set to **Continue where I left off**: We have fixed an issue where when users like yourselves updated to the latest version and lost your session tabs. You will notice that this happens again, but before doing anything, head to the **...** menu in the top right and open the flyout menu for **History**. There should be your session tabs sitting there waiting for you to reload. Going forward, we do not expect any issues with losing tab sessions when updating, but please do let me know if you notice it again in the future.\n\nWe have several fixes coming in hot today. We have two updates for PDFs, the first is honoring the default PDF viewer when opening a PDF from the downloads page; the second is that if Edge crashes for whatever reason while you are making changes to a PDF, the edits you've made on the PDF document will recover. We also added in a new feature where you can turn off the 👁 icon in the password field on websites, rolled out better support for AV1 videos, fixed the issue where the taskbar icon looked really blurry on Windows 10, and added a button to the profile flyout to turn sync on if it's turned off. There's a lot of goodies here, so be sure to check out more by clicking the Change Summary link below.\n\nFor your top feedback, we're updating the status for voice search not working and marking the ability to add themes to Edge as **Addressed**. This week's update is pretty small, so be sure to click the Top Feedback button below to see more details about these two.\n\nThat's it for this week! Next week, you should expect to see Edge 87 roll into our Beta channel and Edge 88 roll into our Dev channel.

You just have to create a new shortcut and access its ***Properties*** by right clicking on it, then, at the end of the target field, you have to add this:

**--enable-features=ScrollableTabStrip**

(After ""ms edge.exe"" you must leave a space)

The full path should look like this:

(you can also add this to the properties of the taskbar button if you wish)

That's it, when you open Edge ***from that shortcut***, the Scrollable tabstrip feature will be enabled:

[**Scrollable tabstrip (Video)**](https://1drv.ms/v/s!AhDT-WcKG-aigbx8pFOUivM9JIRWJg?e=9Ps4gj)

&amp;#x200B;

This feature ***is*** ***only available in Edge Canary (version 88).***

It´s not clear if Microsoft will re-add the flag to enable this feature or if they will add the scrollable tabs to Edge in another way, maybe u/MSFTMissy can ask the Edge developers about this 🙂.

&amp;#x200B;

**PS:** If you have the ""Vertical tabs"" feature and you open Edge Canary using the modified shortcut, ***the browser will crash when clicking the ""Vertical tabs"" button***.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44d9c2cf412361b51051649b869c385e10e7cd21ca77c670f0cd60281e5ec14e.gif""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrollable tabstrip (GIF).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://1drv.ms/v/s!AhDT-WcKG-aigbx8pFOUivM9JIRWJg?e=9Ps4gj""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrollable tabstrip (Video)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;only available in Edge Canary (version 88).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It´s not clear if Microsoft will re-add the flag to enable this feature or if they will add the scrollable tabs to Edge in another way, maybe &lt;a href=""/u/MSFTMissy""&gt;u/MSFTMissy&lt;/a&gt; can ask the Edge developers about this 🙂.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have the &amp;quot;Vertical tabs&amp;quot; feature and you open Edge Canary using the modified shortcut, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the browser will crash when clicking the &amp;quot;Vertical tabs&amp;quot; button&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello,

My company would like to use a page from our  head offices sharepoint site as our home page (intranet) when they open  Edge Chromium (Version 85.0.564.68 (Official build) (64-bit)).

For example:

Head office:

[https://ContosoGroup.sharepoint.com](https://contosogroup.sharepoint.com/)

Our divisional page:

[https://ContosoGroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Div-landing](https://contosogroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Div-landing)  


The users were getting prompted to enter their U&amp;P at sign in.

So I added:

\*.[sharepoint.com](https://contosogroup.sharepoint.com/)

To the Local Intranet websites and auto logon with the users U&amp;P via a Zone Mappings GPO.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nicec5x00oq51.png?width=368&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48007f5859eb3d29b0cd68099eaa729bbf462d13

Now when users logon they can get to head offices website with any prompt (and then our page if they follow the url).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jn5m1y320oq51.png?width=1009&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a88e3f91cc8e50d6b6d86c70a8bb1a23f8449548

But if they open Edge and and go directly to our page ([sites/Div-landing](https://contosogroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Div-landing)) it propts for credentials:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2zb8j0260oq51.png?width=392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=329a624c00a7e4be04866559c0e98a522c89605d

From what I undertand I dont need to add the untire url to the zone mapping.

I've also tested with trusted zone with the same issue.

Could this be an issue with the page on sharepoint we've made?",t2_7ym75,False,,0,False,Sharepoint online - local intranet site,[],r/edge,False,6,,0,,False,t3_j3sml1,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,,1601666018.0,text,6,,,text,self.edge,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

,edge,"Hello,

Our product enabled a Zebra barcode scanner, connected via USB to a PC, to enter scanned barcode data directly into a text field in our application.  The bar code consists of 4 separate elements that had been separated by control characters.   Our software used these breaks to parse the data into the 4 respective fields.   This all worked fine in Edge version (**44.19041.1.0**,) however with the latest versions - these control characters do not present.

I know that the updated code is now based on Chromium - and that our application sees similar behavior when we attempt to scan on Chrome - so my assumption is that this could be the cause.   

My question is, are there any settings that I have overlooked that could once again produce this behavior (i.e. getting the control characters to display with the barcode data?",t2_655ao6tr,False,,0,False,Barcode Scanner no longer captures control characters in latest versions of Edge,[],r/edge,False,6,,0,,False,t3_iziofj,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,,1601066346.0,text,6,,,text,self.edge,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

,edge,"Hi

Little confused here

Ive got Edge stable version 85 installed and setting up some policies. One of them being the URL it goes to when a user clicks the home button

I enabled the policy : **Configure Home button URL** and configured it with my company home page

Along with the other policies you see

The policy is coming down ok:

However the home button is not set to the home page URL set:

So now when a user clicks the home button it goes to a new tab not the URL set

***Note: We are in the process of deploying this feature, so it may be a little while before you see it in your respective channel and build.***

To improve memory and CPU utilization of the browser, we've developed a feature called sleeping tabs.

Early internal testing of devices with sleeping tabs has shown a median memory usage reduction of **26% for Microsoft Edge**. Our internal testing has also shown that a normal background tab uses **29% more CPU for Microsoft Edge** than a sleeping tab. These resource savings should result in excellent battery savings. Although individual device performance varies depending on configuration and usage, we expect the decrease in resource and battery usage to create a better browsing experience for users.

[ Median memory usage of Microsoft Edge based on performance data aggregated across \~13000 devices ](https://preview.redd.it/j61oy8bddzo51.png?width=876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6ead6bbf63519eef1abf7719f12bd588aed672a)

Sleeping tabs builds upon the core of Chromium’s “freezing” technology. Freezing pauses a tab’s script timers to minimize resource usage. A sleeping tab resumes automatically when clicked, which is different than discarded tabs, which require the page to fully be reloaded.

We built upon the freezing technology to create sleeping tabs. This feature allows inactive background tabs to “go to sleep,” releasing system resources after a set amount of time. These resources include both memory and CPU and can be used for new or existing tabs or other applications running on your device.

By default, we’ve set tabs to go to sleep after two hours of inactivity. If two hours isn’t right for you, you can choose a different time interval [in edge://settings/system](https://preview.redd.it/ou689pfqwqn51.png?width=1469&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fddbbc5f88f68d70e98d5e9f4134b08e11c17a0). Tabs that are asleep [will fade](https://preview.redd.it/espyc1220rn51.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afa14f86ab2f24bf0042d09c2a8ca5d0e73b3bf3) to let you know they’ve released resources. To resume a sleeping tab, click on it like a normal tab. The tab will un-fade and your content will be there immediately. You can also [add sites you never want to sleep](https://preview.redd.it/xnk60vchxqn51.png?width=1455&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29f54dad2a9888688db7045e9a0d87624c15de7f) to a block list in Settings.

With this technology, it is possible that some sites may not work as expected after they go to sleep. We have built heuristics to detect these scenarios and prevent those tabs from sleeping to keep you in your flow. We are eager to get your feedback on sleeping tabs. If you experience a compat issue, please refresh the page and let us know through Microsoft Edge by pressing Shift+Alt+I on a Windows device or going to **Settings and more … &gt; Help and feedback &gt; Send feedback**.

Sleeping tabs will be coming soon to Canary and Dev Channels \[87.0.649.0\]. If you see the sleeping tabs feature while browsing, please join us here on the Microsoft Edge Insider forums or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/msedgedev) to discuss your experience, or send us your feedback through the browser! If you have any questions, see our [FAQ](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/sleeping-tabs-faq/m-p/1705434) or reach out to us. We hope you enjoy this exciting new feature and look forward to hearing from you!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/xrrc8zwfdzo51.png?width=877&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a2889e7c5047ed7d48c3ec03aafc0442af50ea47""&gt; Average CPU usage of Microsoft Edge based on performance data aggregated across ~13000 device &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleeping tabs builds upon the core of Chromium’s “freezing” technology. Freezing pauses a tab’s script timers to minimize resource usage. A sleeping tab resumes automatically when clicked, which is different than discarded tabs, which require the page to fully be reloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built upon the freezing technology to create sleeping tabs. This feature allows inactive background tabs to “go to sleep,” releasing system resources after a set amount of time. These resources include both memory and CPU and can be used for new or existing tabs or other applications running on your device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, we’ve set tabs to go to sleep after two hours of inactivity. If two hours isn’t right for you, you can choose a different time interval &lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/ou689pfqwqn51.png?width=1469&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5fddbbc5f88f68d70e98d5e9f4134b08e11c17a0""&gt;in edge://settings/system&lt;/a&gt;. Tabs that are asleep &lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/espyc1220rn51.png?width=864&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=afa14f86ab2f24bf0042d09c2a8ca5d0e73b3bf3""&gt;will fade&lt;/a&gt; to let you know they’ve released resources. To resume a sleeping tab, click on it like a normal tab. The tab will un-fade and your content will be there immediately. You can also &lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/xnk60vchxqn51.png?width=1455&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=29f54dad2a9888688db7045e9a0d87624c15de7f""&gt;add sites you never want to sleep&lt;/a&gt; to a block list in Settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/2ocndbnaezo51.png?width=989&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=32d4a45f34c05bef07d607ca2f3263b3377d26a1""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/2ocndbnaezo51.png?width=989&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=32d4a45f34c05bef07d607ca2f3263b3377d26a1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this technology, it is possible that some sites may not work as expected after they go to sleep. We have built heuristics to detect these scenarios and prevent those tabs from sleeping to keep you in your flow. We are eager to get your feedback on sleeping tabs. If you experience a compat issue, please refresh the page and let us know through Microsoft Edge by pressing Shift+Alt+I on a Windows device or going to &lt;strong&gt;Settings and more … &amp;gt; Help and feedback &amp;gt; Send feedback&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleeping tabs will be coming soon to Canary and Dev Channels [87.0.649.0]. If you see the sleeping tabs feature while browsing, please join us here on the Microsoft Edge Insider forums or &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/msedgedev""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to discuss your experience, or send us your feedback through the browser! If you have any questions, see our &lt;a href=""https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/sleeping-tabs-faq/m-p/1705434""&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; or reach out to us. We hope you enjoy this exciting new feature and look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;
